### Operation 1: View or Modify Source Code or Config

**Use the gemini_cli agent (default):**
Gemini CLI runs in `--yolo` mode and can read and write files directly. Tell the user what you are about to do, then operate on the target files.

**Common edit cases:**
- Modify `config.yaml`: adjust the LLM model, timeout, prompts, admin list, and so on
- Modify `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`: update a skill's instructions or prompt
- Modify Rust source (`bins/`, `crates/`): a rebuild is required before the change takes effect

**Edit flow:**
1. Read the target file first and confirm its current content
2. Make the change
3. Show the diff or a summary to the user and confirm it looks correct
4. If Rust source changed, restart the service so the change can take effect
5. If only `config.yaml` or `skills/` changed, restart is still required because Hone loads them at startup

---

### Operation 2: Restart Hone

**When to use:** after modifying Rust source or config so the change can take effect.

**Restart tool:** `restart_hone(confirm="yes")`

**Flow:**
1. Confirm the edits are done
2. Tell the user: "Hone will restart shortly and be unavailable for about 1-3 minutes, including rebuild time"
3. Call the tool:
   ```text
   restart_hone(confirm="yes")
   ```
4. After the tool returns `success=true`, tell the user:
   - "Hone will stop and restart in about 3 seconds"
   - "The restart includes a rebuild and is expected to take about 1-3 minutes"
   - "The service will recover automatically after the restart; if it is still unresponsive after 5 minutes, check the machine manually"

**Restart mechanism:**
- The tool reads `data/runtime/current.pid` to get the current `hone-cli start` PID
- It waits 3 seconds in the background so the reply can be sent first, then kills the process
- It immediately runs the source CLI build-and-start path in the project root
- The new PID is written to `data/runtime/current.pid`

---

### Operation 3: Check Runtime Status

You can use the following to check the current Hone state:
- Read `data/runtime/current.pid` to see the process PID
- Read `data/logs/restart.log` to see recent restart logs
- Read `data/logs/hone.log` to see the runtime logs

---

### Strict Rules

1. **Confirm before changing**: show a diff or summary before restarting
2. **Restart is risky**: during restart, iMessage and Discord replies may be unavailable
3. **Do not delete critical files**: never delete `config.yaml`, `Cargo.toml`, or the `data/` directory
4. **You must use the tool**: restarts must go through `restart_hone`; do not kill the process directly
5. **Admins only**: if the user is not in the admin list, refuse all admin actions politely

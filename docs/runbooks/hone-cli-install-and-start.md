# Runbook: Hone CLI Install And Start

Last updated: 2026-05-14

## When To Use

- Install Hone from GitHub release assets without cloning the repo
- Prepare a local runtime that starts with `hone-cli start`
- Verify the installed bundle layout and wrapper environment
- Start a source checkout through the local CLI build path

## Install From GitHub

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw/main/scripts/install_hone_cli.sh | bash
```

Optional version pin:

```bash
HONE_VERSION=v0.1.1 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw/main/scripts/install_hone_cli.sh | bash
```

Optional onboarding control:

```bash
HONE_RUN_ONBOARD=0 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw/main/scripts/install_hone_cli.sh | bash
HONE_RUN_ONBOARD=1 curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw/main/scripts/install_hone_cli.sh | bash
```

The installer:

- Downloads the matching release asset such as `honeclaw-darwin-aarch64.tar.gz`
- Verifies that the archive has one safe top-level bundle directory, no path traversal entries, regular required files, an executable `bin/hone-cli`, and both admin/public Web bundles
- Extracts it under `~/.honeclaw/releases/<bundle>`
- Maintains `~/.honeclaw/current` as the active symlink
- Writes a `hone-cli` wrapper to the first writable user-facing bin dir already present in `PATH` when possible
  - Preferred matches are `~/.local/bin`, `~/bin`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.bun/bin`, then other writable `~/...` PATH entries
  - If none of those are available, it falls back to `~/.local/bin/hone-cli` and prints both the immediate `export PATH=...` command and a shell-specific `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` / `~/.bash_profile` persistence hint when it can identify the login shell
- Seeds `~/.honeclaw/config.yaml` and `~/.honeclaw/soul.md` if they do not already exist
- Ships built admin and user Web assets under the install bundle and points the runtime at them through `HONE_WEB_DIST_DIR` / `HONE_PUBLIC_WEB_DIST_DIR`
- In an interactive terminal, asks whether to run `hone-cli onboard` immediately
  - `HONE_RUN_ONBOARD=0` skips the prompt
  - `HONE_RUN_ONBOARD=1` forces onboarding immediately

## Install With Homebrew

```bash
brew install B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw/honeclaw
```

The standard Homebrew tap (`B-M-Capital-Research/homebrew-honeclaw`) installs the same GitHub release bundle under Homebrew `libexec`, then exposes a `hone-cli` wrapper in Homebrew `bin`.

On first run, the wrapper:

- Seeds `~/.honeclaw/config.yaml` and `~/.honeclaw/soul.md` if they do not exist
- Uses the same default `HONE_HOME`, `HONE_USER_CONFIG_PATH`, `HONE_DATA_DIR`, `HONE_SKILLS_DIR`, and bundled Web asset env semantics as the `curl | bash` install
- Exports `HONE_INSTALL_ROOT` to the Homebrew `libexec` bundle instead of `~/.honeclaw/current`
- Lets `hone-cli start` reuse the bundled runtime binaries from the Homebrew cellar without requiring the desktop host

## Uninstall

Homebrew uninstall only removes the package files:

```bash
brew uninstall honeclaw
```

If the formula was installed via the fully qualified tap path, this also works:

```bash
brew uninstall B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw/honeclaw
```

If you also want to remove local Hone config, runtime data, and downloaded bundles under `~/.honeclaw`, run cleanup first:

```bash
hone-cli cleanup
```

For non-interactive full cleanup:

```bash
hone-cli cleanup --all --yes
```

If you already uninstalled Homebrew and no longer have `hone-cli`, remove the install home manually:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.honeclaw
```

## Installed Layout

- Bundle root: `~/.honeclaw/current`
- Canonical user config: `~/.honeclaw/config.yaml`
- Generated effective config: `~/.honeclaw/data/runtime/effective-config.yaml`
- Runtime data: `~/.honeclaw/data`
- Skills dir: `~/.honeclaw/current/share/honeclaw/skills`
- Admin Web assets: `~/.honeclaw/current/share/honeclaw/web`
- User Web assets: `~/.honeclaw/current/share/honeclaw/web-public`

The wrapper exports:

- `HONE_HOME=~/.honeclaw`
- `HONE_INSTALL_ROOT=~/.honeclaw/current`
- `HONE_USER_CONFIG_PATH=~/.honeclaw/config.yaml`
- `HONE_DATA_DIR=~/.honeclaw/data`
- `HONE_SKILLS_DIR=~/.honeclaw/current/share/honeclaw/skills`
- `HONE_WEB_DIST_DIR=~/.honeclaw/current/share/honeclaw/web`
- `HONE_PUBLIC_WEB_DIST_DIR=~/.honeclaw/current/share/honeclaw/web-public`

`HONE_CONFIG_PATH` is no longer exported globally by the wrapper. It is generated and injected only for spawned runtime processes.

## First-Time Setup

Run the local checks first:

```bash
hone-cli doctor
```

Then run the guided onboarding:

```bash
hone-cli onboard
```

The onboarding flow will:

- Preserve the seeded `agent.runner: hone_cloud` route unless you switch to a local runner; set `agent.hone_cloud.api_key` before relying on Hone Cloud
- Detect local runner binaries such as `codex`, `codex-acp`, and `opencode`
- Let you choose the default runner
- If you choose `opencode_acp`, tell you to finish provider / model setup in local `opencode` first
  - Hone defaults to inheriting `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`
- If you choose `multi-agent`, tell you that search needs a dedicated search API key, answer can inherit the `llm.providers.openrouter.api_key/api_keys` pool when no answer key is set, and the answer stage needs local `opencode`
- Ask whether to enable each channel
- If a channel is enabled, require its local mandatory fields and print the key permission / prerequisite notes
- If you accidentally enable a channel and then hit a required field with no value to keep, the wizard offers:
  - retry the current field
  - go back and disable that channel
- Require an explicit choice for `OpenRouter`, `FMP`, and `Tavily` API keys: configure now or skip for this run
  - OpenRouter writes `llm.providers.openrouter.api_keys` and clears legacy single-key fields
  - FMP and Tavily write `fmp.api_keys` and `search.api_keys`
  - `FMP` onboarding also clears the legacy single-key field `fmp.api_key`

Runner install references shown by onboarding:

- `Hone Cloud`
  - No local runner binary is required
  - Recommended config keeps `agent.runner: hone_cloud`
  - Required API key lives at `agent.hone_cloud.api_key`
- `Codex CLI`
  - Install: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
  - Update: `codex --upgrade`
  - Official guide: [OpenAI Codex CLI – Getting Started](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11096431)
- `Codex ACP`
  - Install `codex` first, then install `codex-acp`
  - Minimum validated combination for `gpt-5.5`: `codex >= 0.125.0` and `codex-acp >= 0.12.0`
  - Recommended update command: `npm install -g @openai/codex@latest @zed-industries/codex-acp@latest`
  - 2026-04-30 validation note: `codex` stayed on `0.125.0`, while `codex-acp` upgraded from `0.11.1` to `0.12.0`; `gpt-5.5` failed with HTTP 400 before the adapter upgrade and passed after it.
  - Recommended Hone config:

    ```yaml
    agent:
      runner: codex_acp
      codex_acp:
        model: gpt-5.5
        variant: high
        sandbox_mode: workspace-write
        approval_policy: never
        sandbox_permissions: ["network-full-access"]
    ```

  - Keep `sandbox_permissions: ["network-full-access"]` when `sandbox_mode: workspace-write` is used; Codex CLI otherwise keeps network access closed inside the actor sandbox, which can make `curl`, `git`, and DNS look broken during tool execution.
  - Restart the Hone runtime after changing this config; existing processes keep their previous effective config snapshot.
  - Official adapter repo: [zed-industries/codex-acp](https://github.com/zed-industries/codex-acp)
- `OpenCode ACP`
  - Install: `curl -fsSL https://opencode.ai/install | bash`
  - Official docs: [OpenCode Docs](https://opencode.ai/docs/)
- `multi-agent`
  - Requires local `opencode` for the answer stage because runtime uses the OpenCode ACP runner there
  - Search reads `agent.multi_agent.search.api_key`; if it is empty, only the legacy `llm.auxiliary.api_key` path is used as a fallback
  - Answer reads `agent.multi_agent.answer.*`; if `answer.api_key` is empty while Hone manages the answer route, it can inherit the OpenRouter provider key pool (`llm.providers.openrouter.api_key/api_keys`, with legacy single-key fallback)

If you prefer the older section-by-section setup, use:

```bash
hone-cli configure --section agent --section channels --section providers
```

You can also edit individual values non-interactively:

```bash
hone-cli config set agent.hone_cloud.api_key "<api-key>"
hone-cli config set agent.runner opencode_acp
hone-cli channels set telegram --enabled true --bot-token "<token>"
```

If you want Hone to explicitly override the model used by `opencode_acp`, set it afterwards:

```bash
hone-cli models set --runner opencode_acp --model openrouter/openai/gpt-5.4 --variant medium
```

## Start The Local Runtime

```bash
hone-cli start
```

What `hone-cli start` does in the current MVP:

- Loads canonical `config.yaml`
- Generates `data/runtime/effective-config.yaml`
- Starts `hone-console-page`
- Waits for `/api/meta` on the configured web port
- Starts enabled channel listeners for iMessage / Discord / Feishu / Telegram
- Keeps the process tree in the foreground until `Ctrl-C`

## Start The Web UIs

Installed users should prefer the CLI Web commands over Bun commands. They use the bundled release assets and do not require a source checkout:

```bash
hone-cli web admin-ui
hone-cli web user-ui
```

If `hone-cli start` is already running, these commands detect the live backend and print the matching URL. If the backend is not running, they start `hone-console-page` in a web-only foreground lane:

- `hone-cli web admin-ui`: management console, default `http://127.0.0.1:8077`
- `hone-cli web user-ui`: user-facing page, default `http://127.0.0.1:8088`

For the full runtime with enabled chat channels, keep using `hone-cli start`. Use the `web` commands in another terminal when you want the Web URL / Web-only lane managed by the CLI.

## Start From Source Checkout

Use this path when you cloned the repository and want to run the source tree directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw.git
cd honeclaw
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
cargo run -p hone-cli -- start --build
```

What `--build` adds:

- Builds `hone-cli`, `hone-console-page`, `hone-mcp`, and the channel binaries into the local Cargo target dir
- Starts the runtime from those freshly built local binaries
- Writes `data/runtime/current.pid` after startup so restart tooling can find the active CLI supervisor

For Web UI development, keep the CLI backend running and start the Vite frontends through the CLI:

```bash
cargo run -p hone-cli -- web admin-ui --dev
cargo run -p hone-cli -- web user-ui --dev
```

Direct Bun scripts remain available when you specifically want to operate outside the CLI wrapper:

```bash
bun run dev:web
bun run dev:web:public
```

For desktop development, prepare the Tauri sidecars and run Tauri directly:

```bash
bun run tauri:prep:dev -- --skip-dev-command
bunx tauri dev --config bins/hone-desktop/tauri.generated.conf.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### `hone-cli` not found

Check where the installer placed the wrapper:

```bash
command -v hone-cli || ls -l ~/.local/bin/hone-cli
```

If it fell back to `~/.local/bin`, add that directory to `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

If you installed with Homebrew and `hone-cli` is still missing, the more likely issue is that your shell has not loaded Homebrew's environment yet:

```bash
eval "$($(command -v brew) shellenv)"
```

### `hone-cli start` says a runtime binary is missing

- Reinstall with the latest GitHub bundle
- Confirm that `~/.honeclaw/current/bin/` contains `hone-console-page`, `hone-mcp`, and any enabled channel binaries
- In a source checkout, use `cargo run -p hone-cli -- start --build` so the local runtime binaries are built before startup

### Installer rejects the release asset layout

- Treat messages about unsafe archive paths, multiple top-level roots, non-regular required files, or a non-executable `bin/hone-cli` as release packaging problems
- Reinstall from a newer release asset instead of editing files under `~/.honeclaw/releases` by hand
- If validating a locally built bundle, rebuild the archive so `bin/hone-cli`, `share/honeclaw/config.example.yaml`, `share/honeclaw/soul.md`, `share/honeclaw/web/index.html`, and `share/honeclaw/web-public/index.html` are regular files, and `bin/hone-cli` is executable

### The backend starts but the web page says assets are missing

- Reinstall with the latest GitHub bundle or the latest Homebrew formula
- Confirm that the install root contains `share/honeclaw/web/index.html`
- Confirm that the install root contains `share/honeclaw/web-public/index.html`
- Confirm that `HONE_WEB_DIST_DIR` points at the bundled `share/honeclaw/web`
- Confirm that `HONE_PUBLIC_WEB_DIST_DIR` points at the bundled `share/honeclaw/web-public`

### Config edits seem to affect the wrong file

Check:

```bash
hone-cli config file
```

The installed wrapper should point to `~/.honeclaw/config.yaml`.

### Homebrew install fails to resolve the formula

If you previously tapped the wrong remote, untap it and install again:

```bash
brew untap B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw
brew install B-M-Capital-Research/honeclaw/honeclaw
```

## Goal

Clear the current active bug queue as far as software changes can responsibly do so, prioritizing shared reliability contracts over one-off compatibility hacks for transient network/provider/model behavior.

## Scope

- Triage the 21 active bugs in `docs/bugs/README.md`.
- Group fixes by shared root cause: scheduler delivery/status, ACP unfinished-tool handling, session mirroring, Feishu/Web outbound, heartbeat status/duplicate behavior, event-engine quality, desktop runtime restart, Telegram stale runtime files.
- Implement durable hardening and tests for controllable code paths.
- Keep issues caused by external credentials, provider outages, model nondeterminism, or live network failures documented when code can only improve classification, retry boundaries, or observability.

## Progress

- 2026-04-28: Started from a clean `main...origin/main` workspace, then pulled latest before the burn-down.
- 2026-04-28: Closed 6 active bugs with code changes and moved them to `Fixed` in `docs/bugs/README.md`:
  - Desktop bundled restart 8077 port conflict
  - Web scheduler SSE-only delivery false failure
  - `sessions.sqlite3` mirror disabled by default
  - Once scheduler absolute date loss
  - Telegram `GetMe` startup failure leaving dead pid / heartbeat
  - Event-engine `immediate_kinds` resurrecting Low news
- 2026-04-28: Added hardening for related active scheduler paths without marking the user-facing bugs fully fixed:
  - scheduler event now carries authoritative schedule fields into the channel prompt
  - heartbeat max-iteration failures are no longer treated as compatibility noops
  - web/imessage scheduler now records an initial `running + pending` run before executing
- 2026-04-28: Continued the burn-down and moved the active queue from 15 to 2:
  - blocked cron jobs whose prompt `【触发时间】HH:MM` conflicts with structured schedule, including historical bad data at due-time scan
  - hardened OpenAI-compatible 4xx handling so numeric `error.code` responses preserve the real upstream message instead of collapsing to serde `invalid type`
  - added deterministic heartbeat duplicate suppression against recently delivered previews
  - made empty heartbeat output and empty-status JSON fail the heartbeat contract instead of silently becoming `noop`
  - raised heartbeat auxiliary function-calling max iterations from 6 to 10 so shared heartbeat execution has enough budget without model/provider-specific hacks
  - strengthened heartbeat source attribution rules so oil/geopolitics claims cannot cite Reuters/WSJ/Bloomberg/official sources unless current tool results substantiate that source
  - added single-contact current-app open_id resolution for event-engine Feishu direct sends to avoid stale cross-app actor ids
  - made Web scheduler persist a user-visible failure message for failed runs, including internally-suppressed unfinished-tool failures
  - fixed `launch.sh` zombie child detection for disabled channel pid cleanup
  - suppressed internal Feishu scheduler failure fallbacks for `codex acp prompt ended before tool completion`
  - reviewed event-engine news classifier and convergence guard code paths and moved stale active docs to `Fixed`
- 2026-04-29: Rebased the burn-down work onto latest `origin/main`, then closed four newly active scheduler defects:
  - heartbeat near-threshold false triggers now hit a shared `near_threshold_suppressed` send gate instead of reaching the user when the message itself admits the threshold was only approached
  - Feishu scheduler terminal execution events now update the matching `running + pending` started row by `delivery_key`
  - heartbeat duplicate history now includes the same actor's recent heartbeat deliveries across sibling jobs, not only the current job
- 2026-04-29: Active bug queue is now 3. Remaining active items are Feishu direct empty/invalid answer quality, `sessions.sqlite3` mirror stalled evidence, and Telegram invalid token/live connectivity. Telegram remains a credential/live configuration issue; do not add hard-coded compatibility behavior for it.
- 2026-04-30: Addressed event-engine digest readability feedback from the last 24h push log review: macro digest rows now include actual/expected/previous values or a clear future publish time, earnings surprise rows label EPS explicitly, and digest links render as source-host anchors in Telegram HTML, Discord embeds, and Feishu cards while retaining exact href targets.
- 2026-05-01: Closed the active P1 Feishu `open_id cross app` event-engine regression by widening the Feishu direct current-app fallback from “exactly one email or exactly one mobile” to “all stable contacts resolve to exactly one open_id”. This covers single-user configs that keep both email and mobile while preserving the no-guessing rule for ambiguous multi-user contact sets.
- 2026-05-01: Closed the active P2 watchlist near-threshold regression by extending the heartbeat send gate to parse watchlist price phrases such as `跌至 69.85` and suppress `triggered` outputs that claim `已触及或低于触发价 69.83` while the parsed current price is still above the configured lower trigger line.
- 2026-05-01: Closed the reopened P1 Feishu direct quota rejection bug by preserving quota rejection text before internal-error suppression, including wrapped forms such as `工具执行错误: 已达到今日对话上限...`, and by logging Feishu failure fallback sends as `reply.send failure_fallback` so placeholder updates are auditable.
- 2026-05-02: Closed the daily macOS isolated-config `soul.md` startup bug by copying safe relative `system_prompt_path` assets from bundle/repo resources into the canonical config directory before desktop runtime config loads it. Also moved two stale active entries back to `Fixed` based on current code/test evidence instead of old production samples: Web scheduler offline SSE delivery status and provider numeric `HTTP 400` error preservation.
- 2026-05-02 11:03: Latest bug ledger refresh reopened Web scheduler offline SSE and provider numeric `HTTP 400` based on newer local evidence; keep those active for separate review instead of carrying forward the stale Fixed conclusion.
- 2026-05-02: Closed the Feishu scheduler started-row finalization regression by hardening both sides of the matching contract: scheduler terminal detail now replaces unusable `delivery_key` values, and cron history storage can safely fallback-update the latest recent `phase=started` pending row for the same actor/job/target/heartbeat when exact key matching fails.
- 2026-05-02 17:35: Reopened P1 Feishu direct empty/invalid answer bug is now back to `Fixing` after narrowing `response_finalizer`'s `planning_sentence_suppressed` heuristic. Clarification questions such as “请先确认具体是哪只股票/资产的 ticker？” are no longer treated as empty-success fallbacks, and targeted `hone-channels` regression tests now cover both the helper and full finalizer path. No live Feishu runtime recheck yet because this automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-03 18:06: Closed the active Web `tool_call_update.rawOutput` leak by hardening shared session event emission instead of transcript persistence: `SessionEventEmitter` now relativizes `ToolStatus.tool/message/reasoning`, suppresses internal prompt markers such as `【Invoked Skill Context】` / `Base directory for this skill:`, and drops structured JSON payloads from user-visible progress events while preserving raw ACP evidence for restore/debug. Targeted `hone-channels` emitter tests and `cargo check -p hone-channels --tests` passed. Feishu direct empty/invalid answer remains the only active P1 because this automation run does not restart services or generate new live Feishu samples.
- 2026-05-04 21:15: Tightened the remaining active P1 Feishu direct-answer path again. `multi_agent` search results backed only by read-only local file tools (`local_list_files` / `local_search_files` / `local_read_file`) may now return directly when the answer is already concise and single-paragraph, which covers attachment / local-state confirmation turns that were still being forced into the more failure-prone ACP answer stage. Added targeted `hone-channels` tests to keep verbose local file summaries on the answer path while letting concise confirmations bypass it. No live Feishu runtime recheck yet because this automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-05 10:15: Re-closed the active Feishu `session/update` live leak at the shared boundary after the bug ledger re-opened on newer runtime samples. `SessionEventEmitter` now sanitizes `StreamDelta` with the same user-visible contract as `ToolStatus`, keeping visible prefixes while trimming suffixes that start at `### System Instructions ###` / `【Invoked Skill Context】` / `Base directory for this skill:` and dropping structured JSON payloads entirely. ACP chunk ingest also now suppresses `【Invoked Skill Context】` / `Base directory for this skill:` before they enter the session stream. Targeted `hone-channels` emitter + `acp_common` tests and `cargo check -p hone-channels --tests` passed. Live post-fix Feishu verification is still pending because this automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-06 07:07: Closed the reopened P1 Feishu `session/update` live leak by tightening the Feishu channel boundary itself. `FeishuStreamListener` no longer writes ACP `StreamDelta` chunks into placeholder cards, so analysis drafts / prompt echoes / raw stream fragments cannot be pushed live through Feishu; final replies still use `response.content`, and placeholder/tool-progress buffers are rejected as failed partials or success finals. `hone-feishu` unit tests, `cargo check -p hone-feishu --tests`, and direct rustfmt checks passed. Live deployment verification remains a follow-up because this machine is not production and the automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-07 11:06: Closed the active P3 watchlist hit-zone degradation by tightening the shared scheduled-task contract rather than adding another data-source special case. `build_scheduled_prompt` now injects a stable-local-field rule for ordinary scheduled tasks that mention both watchlists/观察池 and hit zones/击球区, and `multi_agent` search-stage guidance now preserves hit zones from task text, restored context, portfolio/local state, or local files while using `data_fetch` only for fresh prices, fundamentals, and earnings dates. Targeted `hone-channels` prompt/guidance regressions passed. No GitHub issue was linked for this bug.
- 2026-05-09 03:28: Closed the remaining active P2 `sessions.sqlite3` mirror stall by combining two rollout fixes: `hone-cli` config generation/writeback now normalizes `storage.session_sqlite_shadow_write_enabled=true`, and `SessionStorage` now performs startup JSON -> SQLite shadow backfill when JSON remains the runtime backend and shadow write is enabled. This covers both non-desktop launch paths that could keep the writer disabled and historical windows where the writer was disabled: restarting with the corrected config now repairs the existing JSON session mirror instead of waiting for each session to receive another turn. Active `docs/bugs/README.md` queue is now empty; open GitHub Issues from older fixed docs still need human/automation follow-up comments or closure review.
- 2026-05-09 19:06: Re-closed the reopened P2 heartbeat malformed-triggered leak. `recover_malformed_triggered_heartbeat_message` now uses a lossy JSON string-field scanner that confirms `status=triggered`, extracts only the `message` value, tolerates unescaped quotes inside the message, and stops before subsequent fields such as `source/confidence`. The latest `Cerebras IPO` / `RKLB` / `TSLA` shape is covered without turning ordinary malformed JSON, empty output, internal markers, or free text into delivered alerts. No GitHub Issue is linked to the malformed-triggered bug.
- 2026-05-09 19:12: Re-closed the reopened P2 heartbeat cross-job duplicate suppression false skip. `heartbeat_entity_anchors_compatible` now applies a ticker-level hard gate before loose token overlap: if both the current message and prior preview contain explicit ticker anchors and there is no intersection, the preview cannot suppress delivery. Generic English anchors such as `Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4`, `CEO`, `SEC`, and `FDA` are excluded from entity compatibility. Added regressions for `RKLB -> ASTS`, `RKLB -> TEM`, and `RKLB -> portfolio ASTS`; active `docs/bugs/README.md` queue is now empty again. No GitHub Issue is linked to this bug.
- 2026-05-10 03:07: Re-closed the reopened P3 watchlist hit-zone degradation again, this time by moving the fix from prompt-only guidance into scheduler input construction. Watchlist tasks that mention hit zones now recover ticker -> zone mappings from the current actor session's `compact summary` / `session.summary` and append them as explicit `【已恢复的本地击球区参考】` bullets before execution, so the answer stage no longer has to rediscover or remember the stable local ranges on its own. Added `scheduled_watchlist_prompt_recovers_hit_zones_from_compact_summary` and re-ran the existing stable-local-field regression; active queue is now reduced to the oil heartbeat causality-guard bug.
- 2026-05-13 04:36: Closed the active P2 heartbeat `mimo-v2.5-pro` `Param Incorrect` batch failure. The root cause was not a generic provider parameter mismatch: the auxiliary function-calling loop dropped assistant `reasoning_content` between the first tool-calling turn and the follow-up tool-result turn, while `mimo-v2.5-pro` thinking mode requires that field to be echoed back. Fixed the shared path in `hone-agent` + `hone-llm` by preserving/replaying `reasoning_content`, switched OpenAI-compatible non-streaming requests with reasoning transcripts onto explicit raw JSON bodies, and narrowed heartbeat tool exposure to a small allowlist to reduce schema bloat. Targeted `hone-llm` / `hone-agent` / `hone-channels` regressions pass. Remaining active queue is now 2 Feishu-facing output issues (`feishu_direct_partial_reply_before_tool_completion` and `feishu_company_profile_absolute_path_leak`), both higher priority than any remaining P2/P3 and should be handled first next run.
- 2026-05-14 04:24: Closed the active P1 Web direct cross-session sandbox exposure. The actual code path was still letting actor sandboxes live under repo `data/agent-sandboxes`, despite the bug doc already claiming a fix. `hone-channels::sandbox` now rejects repo-internal sandbox roots and falls back to a repo-external temp sandbox, removes stray `portfolio_*.json` / `portfolio/` / `portfolios/` entries before handing the directory to native-file runners, and `hone-desktop` now carries an explicit `sandbox_dir` instead of re-exporting repo `data/agent-sandboxes`. Targeted `hone-channels` and `hone-desktop` regressions plus `cargo check` passed. Live runtime verification is still pending because this automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-11 03:06: Re-closed the reopened P3 watchlist hit-zone degradation after the latest recurrence showed that “current 25-stock watchlist” task text can omit explicit tickers. `recover_watchlist_hit_zone_context` no longer returns early when the task prompt has no ticker; in that shape it scans the current compact summary / session summary for watchlist table and inline hit-zone entries, restores every valid ticker -> zone mapping, and still rejects `待确认` or non-dollar values. Added `scheduled_watchlist_prompt_recovers_all_hit_zones_when_task_omits_tickers`; active bug queue is now empty again. No GitHub Issue is linked to this bug.
- 2026-05-15 08:07: Closed the active P1 Daily macOS release app API lifecycle bug by adding `HONE_DESKTOP_SMOKE_SERVER=1` to `hone-desktop`. The packaged desktop executable can now run a headless Web/API smoke server on fixed ports, independent of Tauri window lifecycle, and stays alive until Ctrl-C. Local smoke verified `/api/meta`, the public user page, and disabled channel status on `18077/18088`; Issue #42 is linked in the bug doc.
- 2026-05-15 08:07: Re-closed the active P2 oil scheduler recurrence based on current code and a new exact regression for the latest contract-month sample. The existing ordinary scheduler commodity guard already rewrites unsafe `Brent Jul 2026 / WTI Jun 2026` approximate prices and tech-stock tail-risk causality into a safe notice; the latest `detail_json.scheduler=null` evidence is treated as old/non-production runtime state, not as a current HEAD failure. Active bug queue is now empty.
- 2026-05-16 03:05: Re-closed the reopened P1 Feishu direct empty/invalid answer bug after the latest 2026-05-15 21:48 / 22:07 samples showed two remaining `planning_sentence_suppressed` gaps. `response_finalizer` now recovers successful `portfolio` side effects into user-visible confirmations, and `is_transitional_planning_sentence(...)` keeps “把图发给我 / 上传截图” style attachment guidance instead of collapsing it into the generic fallback. Added focused `hone-channels` regressions plus `cargo check`; active bug queue remains empty.

## Validation

- Run targeted Rust unit tests for changed crates/modules.
- Run targeted frontend tests when web UI or API client behavior changes.
- Run formatting checks for changed Rust files where practical.
- Re-check `git status` and active bug documentation before closing.

Known verification limitation:

- `bash scripts/ci/check_fmt_changed.sh` cannot run under the system Bash 3 environment because it uses `mapfile`; changed Rust files were formatted directly with `rustfmt --edition 2024`.
- 本轮再次尝试 `bash scripts/ci/check_fmt_changed.sh`，仍因系统 Bash 3 缺少 `mapfile` 失败；已改用 `rustfmt --edition 2024 --check` 覆盖本轮改动 Rust 文件。
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` still fails on pre-existing formatting drift outside this patch (`crates/hone-channels/src/agent_session/tests.rs`, `crates/hone-core/src/quiet.rs`, `crates/hone-event-engine/src/digest/curation.rs`, `crates/hone-event-engine/src/prefs.rs`, `crates/hone-event-engine/src/router/policy.rs`, `crates/hone-tools/src/notification_prefs_tool.rs`); touched event-engine files pass direct `rustfmt --edition 2024 --check`.

## Documentation Sync

- Update `docs/bugs/README.md` and touched bug documents with status, fix notes, and verification.
- Update this plan while work is active.
- When the batch is closed or paused, write a handoff and either keep this plan active or move it to archive with an `docs/archive/index.md` entry.

## Risks / Open Questions

- Some active bugs depend on production credentials, live Feishu/Telegram/OpenRouter behavior, or model output quality; these should be hardened through contracts and evidence, not hidden behind brittle provider-specific special cases.
- The active queue spans several ongoing plans, so edits must avoid reverting unrelated in-progress work.

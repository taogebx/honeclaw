## Goal

Clear the current active bug queue as far as software changes can responsibly do so, prioritizing shared reliability contracts over one-off compatibility hacks for transient network/provider/model behavior.

## Scope

- Triage the 21 active bugs in `docs/bugs/README.md`.
- Group fixes by shared root cause: scheduler delivery/status, ACP unfinished-tool handling, session mirroring, Feishu/Web outbound, heartbeat status/duplicate behavior, event-engine quality, desktop runtime restart, Telegram stale runtime files.
- Implement durable hardening and tests for controllable code paths.
- Keep issues caused by external credentials, provider outages, model nondeterminism, or live network failures documented when code can only improve classification, retry boundaries, or observability.

## Progress

- 2026-06-09 04:43: Rebased onto remote `main`, which had already closed 3 user-visible wording P3 bugs through shared sanitizer hardening, then closed the 4 remaining active bugs after Rust verification recovered. Changes now verified: ACP stream disconnect sanitization and scheduler failure classification, Feishu daily-limit assistant-tail dedupe, finance all-in / concentrated-position and per-symbol fresh-quote prompt guards, plus a cron task status user-language prompt guard that complements the remote sanitizer fix. Active bug queue in `docs/bugs/README.md` is now 0. Focused tests and `cargo check -p hone-channels --tests` passed; default target `cargo check -p hone-feishu --tests` hung in rustc at 0% CPU, but the same check passed with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/honeclaw-feishu-check CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`, confirming a local cache/toolchain issue rather than a code failure.
- 2026-06-09 00:12: Prepared code/prompt hardening for all 6 currently active bugs but left the queue in `Fixing` because the local Rust toolchain is hanging before any real test can run. Changes prepared: ACP stream disconnect now maps to a safe direct error and scheduler ledger failure kind instead of `noop`; Feishu daily-limit failure fallback now skips duplicate assistant tail messages; cron task prompt now maps `enabled=true/false` into user language; finance policy now blocks all-in single-stock ranking/concentrated allocation templates and requires per-symbol fresh quote verification; company-profile path leak remains covered by existing sanitizer regression pending rerun. `git diff --check` passed. Required next step is to restore cargo/rustc, run the targeted tests listed in the bug docs plus `cargo check` for changed crates, then mark bugs `Fixed`, commit, and push if tests pass.
- 2026-06-08 16:11: Closed the active P2 `web_direct_image_attachment_not_readable_internal_debug_leak` at code level. Public Web chat now routes uploaded attachments through the shared `hone-channels` ingest path instead of appending raw `[附件: path]` lines; local uploads are copied into the actor sandbox, and cloud `oss://` public uploads are downloaded via OSS before being handed to the runner. Shared attachment ingest now keeps the current-turn local path even after uploading the artifact to actor OSS in cloud mode, and image attachment guidance now prefers the local readable path while calling `image_understanding` only when the skill is actually exposed. Added focused public attachment regressions and reran `cargo check -p hone-web-api --tests` plus `cargo check -p hone-channels --tests`. Active queue is 7 and still has no `P0/P1`.
- 2026-06-08 03:06: Closed the active P2 `discord_scheduler_completed_report_send_failed_without_error` at code level and re-confirmed the stale P1 rows are already fixed in current HEAD. `bins/hone-discord/src/utils.rs` now returns segment-send errors alongside `sent_segments/total_segments`, and `bins/hone-discord/src/scheduler.rs` now persists a non-empty `error_message` whenever Discord delivery fails before any segment is sent, falling back to a generic `Discord 定时任务发送失败` if the SDK surfaces no detail. Added focused `hone-discord` tests for the error-message selection path; `cargo test -p hone-discord scheduler_error_message_ -- --nocapture`, `cargo test -p hone-discord segment_send_result_keeps_error_message -- --nocapture`, `cargo check -p hone-discord --tests`, and `rustfmt --edition 2024 --check bins/hone-discord/src/scheduler.rs bins/hone-discord/src/utils.rs` passed. Current active queue has no `P0/P1`; remaining active items are `P2/P3`.
- 2026-06-03 03:07: Closed the active P2 `web_scheduler_acp_stream_disconnect_no_final` enough for code-level closure. `crates/hone-web-api/src/routes/events.rs` now broadcasts the productized Web scheduler failure reply through the same `scheduled_message` SSE path used by successful runs, instead of only persisting it into session history. This means an online Web chat sees `定时任务「...」执行出错，请稍后重试。` immediately when ACP transport disconnect/internal-error paths are suppressed into a generic scheduler failure. Added `build_web_scheduler_push_event_uses_scheduled_message_payload` and `emit_web_scheduler_push_broadcasts_failure_prompt`; `cargo test -p hone-web-api scheduler_failure_trace_required_ -- --nocapture`, `cargo test -p hone-web-api web_scheduler_ -- --nocapture`, the two new focused tests, and `cargo check -p hone-web-api --tests` passed. Active bug queue is back to 0 pending live cloud/Web verification.
- 2026-06-02 03:12: Added another reliability guard on top of the already-fixed P1 `feishu_scheduler_no_runs_after_midnight`. `hone-feishu` now starts the Feishu cron producer through a supervised spawn, so if `scheduler.start()` ever panics or exits unexpectedly, the runtime logs the failure and restarts the due-scan loop after 1 second instead of silently abandoning all future cron ticks. Added `handler::tests::supervised_task_restarts_after_panic`; `cargo test -p hone-feishu supervised_task_restarts_after_panic -- --nocapture` and `cargo check -p hone-feishu --tests` passed. Active bug queue remains 0.
- 2026-05-30 16:10: Re-closed the reopened P1 Codex version-probe resource exhaustion bug linked to Issue #43. Codex ACP version validation now caches successful `codex --version` + codex-acp initialize checks by effective runner config, so direct / scheduler traffic does not create two extra probe children on every turn. If only the version-probe step hits a transient local resource limit such as `Resource temporarily unavailable` / `os error 35` / `would block`, the preflight logs a warning and continues to the real runner startup path; missing binaries, old versions, unparsable versions, and real runner startup failures still fail normally. Active bug queue is back to 0.
- 2026-05-30 00:09: Re-closed the reopened P2 scheduler commodity-guard false positive for low-segmentation A/H market reviews. `text_is_predominantly_commodity_related(...)` now compares broad-market anchors against commodity anchors even when the response has only one or two sentence segments, so an A股/港股/美股/AI market review with WTI/Brent/oil only in a risk note is not fully replaced by the commodity safety notice. Added `commodity_guard_skips_low_segmentation_ah_market_review_with_oil_risk_note`; `commodity_guard_`, `commodity_`, `cargo check -p hone-channels --tests`, and rustfmt check passed. Active bug queue is back to 0.
- 2026-05-29 00:13: Reconciled the active queue after `a78d3f2e fix: harden event digest and commodity guards` landed on `origin/main`. Current HEAD already covers both remaining active bugs: Feishu event digest `open_id cross app` now invalidates direct open_id cache and retries after `99992361`, while scheduler commodity guard skips broad-market review samples that only mention oil as a secondary risk variable. Verified `cargo test -p hone-event-engine feishu --lib -- --nocapture` and `cargo test -p hone-channels commodity_guard_ --lib -- --nocapture`; `docs/bugs/README.md` active queue is back to 0. This run did not require a new code patch because the code fix was already present; it synchronized the ledger and issue follow-up state.
- 2026-05-28 03:11: Re-closed the reopened P1 event-engine Feishu direct digest `open_id cross app` regression by restoring the intended “all stable contacts resolve to one current-app open_id” contract end-to-end: Web API now forwards every stable direct contact target per actor, and `FeishuSink` now merges repeated actor entries instead of overwriting them. The same run also closed the active P2 heartbeat stale gold-price trigger by suppressing `JsonTriggered` deliveries whose current/latest-price message carries an explicit date older than the current Beijing date. Targeted `hone-event-engine` / `hone-web-api` / `hone-channels` tests and `cargo check -p hone-event-engine -p hone-web-api -p hone-channels --tests` passed. The remaining active bug is the scheduler commodity-guard false positive; current local regressions already pass, so the next run needs a live sample shape that still reproduces before making another code change.
- 2026-04-28: Started from a clean `main...origin/main` workspace, then pulled latest before the burn-down.
- 2026-04-28: Closed 6 active bugs with code changes and moved them to `Fixed` in `docs/bugs/README.md`:
  - Desktop bundled restart 8077 port conflict
  - Web scheduler SSE-only delivery false failure
  - `sessions.sqlite3` mirror disabled by default
  - Once scheduler absolute date loss
  - Telegram `GetMe` startup failure leaving dead pid / heartbeat
  - Event-engine `immediate_kinds` resurrecting Low news
- 2026-04-28: Added hardening for related active scheduler paths without marking the user-facing bugs fully fixed:
  - scheduler event now carries authoritative schedule fields into the channel prompt
  - heartbeat max-iteration failures are no longer treated as compatibility noops
  - web/imessage scheduler now records an initial `running + pending` run before executing
- 2026-04-28: Continued the burn-down and moved the active queue from 15 to 2:
  - blocked cron jobs whose prompt `【触发时间】HH:MM` conflicts with structured schedule, including historical bad data at due-time scan
  - hardened OpenAI-compatible 4xx handling so numeric `error.code` responses preserve the real upstream message instead of collapsing to serde `invalid type`
  - added deterministic heartbeat duplicate suppression against recently delivered previews
  - made empty heartbeat output and empty-status JSON fail the heartbeat contract instead of silently becoming `noop`
  - raised heartbeat auxiliary function-calling max iterations from 6 to 10 so shared heartbeat execution has enough budget without model/provider-specific hacks
  - strengthened heartbeat source attribution rules so oil/geopolitics claims cannot cite Reuters/WSJ/Bloomberg/official sources unless current tool results substantiate that source
  - added single-contact current-app open_id resolution for event-engine Feishu direct sends to avoid stale cross-app actor ids
  - made Web scheduler persist a user-visible failure message for failed runs, including internally-suppressed unfinished-tool failures
  - fixed `launch.sh` zombie child detection for disabled channel pid cleanup
  - suppressed internal Feishu scheduler failure fallbacks for `codex acp prompt ended before tool completion`
  - reviewed event-engine news classifier and convergence guard code paths and moved stale active docs to `Fixed`
- 2026-04-29: Rebased the burn-down work onto latest `origin/main`, then closed four newly active scheduler defects:
  - heartbeat near-threshold false triggers now hit a shared `near_threshold_suppressed` send gate instead of reaching the user when the message itself admits the threshold was only approached
  - Feishu scheduler terminal execution events now update the matching `running + pending` started row by `delivery_key`
  - heartbeat duplicate history now includes the same actor's recent heartbeat deliveries across sibling jobs, not only the current job
- 2026-04-29: Active bug queue is now 3. Remaining active items are Feishu direct empty/invalid answer quality, `sessions.sqlite3` mirror stalled evidence, and Telegram invalid token/live connectivity. Telegram remains a credential/live configuration issue; do not add hard-coded compatibility behavior for it.
- 2026-04-30: Addressed event-engine digest readability feedback from the last 24h push log review: macro digest rows now include actual/expected/previous values or a clear future publish time, earnings surprise rows label EPS explicitly, and digest links render as source-host anchors in Telegram HTML, Discord embeds, and Feishu cards while retaining exact href targets.
- 2026-05-01: Closed the active P1 Feishu `open_id cross app` event-engine regression by widening the Feishu direct current-app fallback from “exactly one email or exactly one mobile” to “all stable contacts resolve to exactly one open_id”. This covers single-user configs that keep both email and mobile while preserving the no-guessing rule for ambiguous multi-user contact sets.
- 2026-05-01: Closed the active P2 watchlist near-threshold regression by extending the heartbeat send gate to parse watchlist price phrases such as `跌至 69.85` and suppress `triggered` outputs that claim `已触及或低于触发价 69.83` while the parsed current price is still above the configured lower trigger line.
- 2026-05-01: Closed the reopened P1 Feishu direct quota rejection bug by preserving quota rejection text before internal-error suppression, including wrapped forms such as `工具执行错误: 已达到今日对话上限...`, and by logging Feishu failure fallback sends as `reply.send failure_fallback` so placeholder updates are auditable.
- 2026-05-02: Closed the daily macOS isolated-config `soul.md` startup bug by copying safe relative `system_prompt_path` assets from bundle/repo resources into the canonical config directory before desktop runtime config loads it. Also moved two stale active entries back to `Fixed` based on current code/test evidence instead of old production samples: Web scheduler offline SSE delivery status and provider numeric `HTTP 400` error preservation.
- 2026-05-02 11:03: Latest bug ledger refresh reopened Web scheduler offline SSE and provider numeric `HTTP 400` based on newer local evidence; keep those active for separate review instead of carrying forward the stale Fixed conclusion.
- 2026-05-02: Closed the Feishu scheduler started-row finalization regression by hardening both sides of the matching contract: scheduler terminal detail now replaces unusable `delivery_key` values, and cron history storage can safely fallback-update the latest recent `phase=started` pending row for the same actor/job/target/heartbeat when exact key matching fails.
- 2026-05-02 17:35: Reopened P1 Feishu direct empty/invalid answer bug is now back to `Fixing` after narrowing `response_finalizer`'s `planning_sentence_suppressed` heuristic. Clarification questions such as “请先确认具体是哪只股票/资产的 ticker？” are no longer treated as empty-success fallbacks, and targeted `hone-channels` regression tests now cover both the helper and full finalizer path. No live Feishu runtime recheck yet because this automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-03 18:06: Closed the active Web `tool_call_update.rawOutput` leak by hardening shared session event emission instead of transcript persistence: `SessionEventEmitter` now relativizes `ToolStatus.tool/message/reasoning`, suppresses internal prompt markers such as `【Invoked Skill Context】` / `Base directory for this skill:`, and drops structured JSON payloads from user-visible progress events while preserving raw ACP evidence for restore/debug. Targeted `hone-channels` emitter tests and `cargo check -p hone-channels --tests` passed. Feishu direct empty/invalid answer remains the only active P1 because this automation run does not restart services or generate new live Feishu samples.
- 2026-05-04 21:15: Tightened the remaining active P1 Feishu direct-answer path again. `multi_agent` search results backed only by read-only local file tools (`local_list_files` / `local_search_files` / `local_read_file`) may now return directly when the answer is already concise and single-paragraph, which covers attachment / local-state confirmation turns that were still being forced into the more failure-prone ACP answer stage. Added targeted `hone-channels` tests to keep verbose local file summaries on the answer path while letting concise confirmations bypass it. No live Feishu runtime recheck yet because this automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-05 10:15: Re-closed the active Feishu `session/update` live leak at the shared boundary after the bug ledger re-opened on newer runtime samples. `SessionEventEmitter` now sanitizes `StreamDelta` with the same user-visible contract as `ToolStatus`, keeping visible prefixes while trimming suffixes that start at `### System Instructions ###` / `【Invoked Skill Context】` / `Base directory for this skill:` and dropping structured JSON payloads entirely. ACP chunk ingest also now suppresses `【Invoked Skill Context】` / `Base directory for this skill:` before they enter the session stream. Targeted `hone-channels` emitter + `acp_common` tests and `cargo check -p hone-channels --tests` passed. Live post-fix Feishu verification is still pending because this automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-06 07:07: Closed the reopened P1 Feishu `session/update` live leak by tightening the Feishu channel boundary itself. `FeishuStreamListener` no longer writes ACP `StreamDelta` chunks into placeholder cards, so analysis drafts / prompt echoes / raw stream fragments cannot be pushed live through Feishu; final replies still use `response.content`, and placeholder/tool-progress buffers are rejected as failed partials or success finals. `hone-feishu` unit tests, `cargo check -p hone-feishu --tests`, and direct rustfmt checks passed. Live deployment verification remains a follow-up because this machine is not production and the automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-07 11:06: Closed the active P3 watchlist hit-zone degradation by tightening the shared scheduled-task contract rather than adding another data-source special case. `build_scheduled_prompt` now injects a stable-local-field rule for ordinary scheduled tasks that mention both watchlists/观察池 and hit zones/击球区, and `multi_agent` search-stage guidance now preserves hit zones from task text, restored context, portfolio/local state, or local files while using `data_fetch` only for fresh prices, fundamentals, and earnings dates. Targeted `hone-channels` prompt/guidance regressions passed. No GitHub issue was linked for this bug.
- 2026-05-09 03:28: Closed the remaining active P2 `sessions.sqlite3` mirror stall by combining two rollout fixes: `hone-cli` config generation/writeback now normalizes `storage.session_sqlite_shadow_write_enabled=true`, and `SessionStorage` now performs startup JSON -> SQLite shadow backfill when JSON remains the runtime backend and shadow write is enabled. This covers both non-desktop launch paths that could keep the writer disabled and historical windows where the writer was disabled: restarting with the corrected config now repairs the existing JSON session mirror instead of waiting for each session to receive another turn. Active `docs/bugs/README.md` queue is now empty; open GitHub Issues from older fixed docs still need human/automation follow-up comments or closure review.
- 2026-05-09 19:06: Re-closed the reopened P2 heartbeat malformed-triggered leak. `recover_malformed_triggered_heartbeat_message` now uses a lossy JSON string-field scanner that confirms `status=triggered`, extracts only the `message` value, tolerates unescaped quotes inside the message, and stops before subsequent fields such as `source/confidence`. The latest `Cerebras IPO` / `RKLB` / `TSLA` shape is covered without turning ordinary malformed JSON, empty output, internal markers, or free text into delivered alerts. No GitHub Issue is linked to the malformed-triggered bug.
- 2026-05-27 03:04: Re-closed the reopened P2 scheduler commodity-guard false positive. `guard_commodity_causality_for_event(...)` now compares broad-market anchors against commodity anchors before treating a long paragraph as predominantly commodity-related, so OWALERT / XME / 宏观日历 / 大盘风控类正文里的局部油价观察项不再触发整篇 rewrite. Updated `hone-channels` regressions keep the broad-market false-positive samples open while still guarding genuinely oil-dominant bodies. Active `docs/bugs/README.md` queue is back to 0; live deployment verification remains a follow-up because this automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-09 19:12: Re-closed the reopened P2 heartbeat cross-job duplicate suppression false skip. `heartbeat_entity_anchors_compatible` now applies a ticker-level hard gate before loose token overlap: if both the current message and prior preview contain explicit ticker anchors and there is no intersection, the preview cannot suppress delivery. Generic English anchors such as `Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4`, `CEO`, `SEC`, and `FDA` are excluded from entity compatibility. Added regressions for `RKLB -> ASTS`, `RKLB -> TEM`, and `RKLB -> portfolio ASTS`; active `docs/bugs/README.md` queue is now empty again. No GitHub Issue is linked to this bug.
- 2026-05-10 03:07: Re-closed the reopened P3 watchlist hit-zone degradation again, this time by moving the fix from prompt-only guidance into scheduler input construction. Watchlist tasks that mention hit zones now recover ticker -> zone mappings from the current actor session's `compact summary` / `session.summary` and append them as explicit `【已恢复的本地击球区参考】` bullets before execution, so the answer stage no longer has to rediscover or remember the stable local ranges on its own. Added `scheduled_watchlist_prompt_recovers_hit_zones_from_compact_summary` and re-ran the existing stable-local-field regression; active queue is now reduced to the oil heartbeat causality-guard bug.
- 2026-05-13 04:36: Closed the active P2 heartbeat `mimo-v2.5-pro` `Param Incorrect` batch failure. The root cause was not a generic provider parameter mismatch: the auxiliary function-calling loop dropped assistant `reasoning_content` between the first tool-calling turn and the follow-up tool-result turn, while `mimo-v2.5-pro` thinking mode requires that field to be echoed back. Fixed the shared path in `hone-agent` + `hone-llm` by preserving/replaying `reasoning_content`, switched OpenAI-compatible non-streaming requests with reasoning transcripts onto explicit raw JSON bodies, and narrowed heartbeat tool exposure to a small allowlist to reduce schema bloat. Targeted `hone-llm` / `hone-agent` / `hone-channels` regressions pass. Remaining active queue is now 2 Feishu-facing output issues (`feishu_direct_partial_reply_before_tool_completion` and `feishu_company_profile_absolute_path_leak`), both higher priority than any remaining P2/P3 and should be handled first next run.
- 2026-05-14 04:24: Closed the active P1 Web direct cross-session sandbox exposure. The actual code path was still letting actor sandboxes live under repo `data/agent-sandboxes`, despite the bug doc already claiming a fix. `hone-channels::sandbox` now rejects repo-internal sandbox roots and falls back to a repo-external temp sandbox, removes stray `portfolio_*.json` / `portfolio/` / `portfolios/` entries before handing the directory to native-file runners, and `hone-desktop` now carries an explicit `sandbox_dir` instead of re-exporting repo `data/agent-sandboxes`. Targeted `hone-channels` and `hone-desktop` regressions plus `cargo check` passed. Live runtime verification is still pending because this automation does not restart services.
- 2026-05-11 03:06: Re-closed the reopened P3 watchlist hit-zone degradation after the latest recurrence showed that “current 25-stock watchlist” task text can omit explicit tickers. `recover_watchlist_hit_zone_context` no longer returns early when the task prompt has no ticker; in that shape it scans the current compact summary / session summary for watchlist table and inline hit-zone entries, restores every valid ticker -> zone mapping, and still rejects `待确认` or non-dollar values. Added `scheduled_watchlist_prompt_recovers_all_hit_zones_when_task_omits_tickers`; active bug queue is now empty again. No GitHub Issue is linked to this bug.
- 2026-05-15 08:07: Closed the active P1 Daily macOS release app API lifecycle bug by adding `HONE_DESKTOP_SMOKE_SERVER=1` to `hone-desktop`. The packaged desktop executable can now run a headless Web/API smoke server on fixed ports, independent of Tauri window lifecycle, and stays alive until Ctrl-C. Local smoke verified `/api/meta`, the public user page, and disabled channel status on `18077/18088`; Issue #42 is linked in the bug doc.
- 2026-05-15 08:07: Re-closed the active P2 oil scheduler recurrence based on current code and a new exact regression for the latest contract-month sample. The existing ordinary scheduler commodity guard already rewrites unsafe `Brent Jul 2026 / WTI Jun 2026` approximate prices and tech-stock tail-risk causality into a safe notice; the latest `detail_json.scheduler=null` evidence is treated as old/non-production runtime state, not as a current HEAD failure. Active bug queue is now empty.
- 2026-05-16 03:05: Re-closed the reopened P1 Feishu direct empty/invalid answer bug after the latest 2026-05-15 21:48 / 22:07 samples showed two remaining `planning_sentence_suppressed` gaps. `response_finalizer` now recovers successful `portfolio` side effects into user-visible confirmations, and `is_transitional_planning_sentence(...)` keeps “把图发给我 / 上传截图” style attachment guidance instead of collapsing it into the generic fallback. Added focused `hone-channels` regressions plus `cargo check`; active bug queue remains empty.
- 2026-05-20 11:30: Closed the user-reported The Fly broken-link push regression. AnalystGrade events now keep raw FMP `payload.newsURL` for fanout/cooldown dedupe, but user-visible rendering filters The Fly internal `/ajax/news_get.php` and app-shell `/news.php` entrypoints. The attempted `news.php?symbol=AMD` replacement was verified to land on the The Fly app/home shell rather than a stable AMD news list, so the final policy is to omit unstable The Fly links unless upstream provides a stable public permalink or a non-The Fly URL.
- 2026-05-20 20:06: Closed GitHub Issue #44 / P1 heartbeat `mimo-v2.5-pro` 429 quota exhaustion. The controllable bug was not the external quota itself, but the runtime ignoring configured non-OpenRouter `llm.providers.<name>.api_keys` after the first key. `OpenAiCompatibleProvider` now performs non-streaming key-pool fallback, profile resolution passes the full key pool, and heartbeat classifies 429 / rate-limit / resource-exhausted failures as `provider_quota_exhausted`. Active bug queue is empty again.
- 2026-05-22 10:05: Closed the active P2 Feishu PDF CMap parser panic bug. Shared PDF extraction now catches `pdf_extract` / `adobe-cmap-parser` panics and returns stable `pdf_text_extract_failed`; attachment prompt lines, PDF notes, and ack messages sanitize historical `task panicked`, crate source path, and local absolute-path details before they can enter LLM-visible context. Active bug queue is empty again. No GitHub Issue is linked to this bug.
- 2026-05-23 12:04: Closed the reopened P2 heartbeat context-window overflow status bug. Heartbeat runner context overflow is no longer converted into `ContextOverflowNoop`; it now keeps `ScheduledTaskExecution.error` and records `failure_kind=context_window_overflow` plus `parse_kind=ContextOverflowError`, so channel histories land as `execution_failed + skipped_error` instead of `noop + skipped_noop`. No GitHub Issue is linked to the context-overflow bug.
- 2026-05-23 12:13: Closed the remaining active P2 heartbeat structured-status degradation bug. Heartbeat JSON status aliases now normalize common `not_triggered` / `condition_met` shapes, complete internal-only `<think>` outputs that explicitly say no trigger normalize to `PlainTextNoop`, and the heartbeat prompt now blocks tool/task/profile configuration fragments such as `set_immediate_kinds` / `cron_job` as final output. Active bug queue is empty again. No GitHub Issue is linked to this bug.
- 2026-05-26 03:05: Closed the remaining active P2 `scheduler_commodity_guard_false_positive_market_review`. Ordinary scheduler commodity rewrite now stays limited to commodity-first tasks or commodity-dominant content, while broad market reviews with only secondary oil/energy clauses skip the full rewrite. Added focused `hone-channels` regressions for US market risk briefs and cross-market close reviews plus reran the `commodity_` suite and `cargo check -p hone-channels --tests`. Active bug queue is empty again.

## Validation

- Run targeted Rust unit tests for changed crates/modules.
- Run targeted frontend tests when web UI or API client behavior changes.
- Run formatting checks for changed Rust files where practical.
- Re-check `git status` and active bug documentation before closing.

Known verification limitation:

- `bash scripts/ci/check_fmt_changed.sh` cannot run under the system Bash 3 environment because it uses `mapfile`; changed Rust files were formatted directly with `rustfmt --edition 2024`.
- 本轮再次尝试 `bash scripts/ci/check_fmt_changed.sh`，仍因系统 Bash 3 缺少 `mapfile` 失败；已改用 `rustfmt --edition 2024 --check` 覆盖本轮改动 Rust 文件。
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` still fails on pre-existing formatting drift outside this patch (`crates/hone-channels/src/agent_session/tests.rs`, `crates/hone-core/src/quiet.rs`, `crates/hone-event-engine/src/digest/curation.rs`, `crates/hone-event-engine/src/prefs.rs`, `crates/hone-event-engine/src/router/policy.rs`, `crates/hone-tools/src/notification_prefs_tool.rs`); touched event-engine files pass direct `rustfmt --edition 2024 --check`.

## Documentation Sync

- Update `docs/bugs/README.md` and touched bug documents with status, fix notes, and verification.
- Update this plan while work is active.
- When the batch is closed or paused, write a handoff and either keep this plan active or move it to archive with an `docs/archive/index.md` entry.

## Risks / Open Questions

- Some active bugs depend on production credentials, live Feishu/Telegram/OpenRouter behavior, or model output quality; these should be hardened through contracts and evidence, not hidden behind brittle provider-specific special cases.
- The active queue spans several ongoing plans, so edits must avoid reverting unrelated in-progress work.

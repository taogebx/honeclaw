## Summary

SEC filing enrichment is now wired through its own OpenRouter provider with a completion budget capped by `event_engine.sec_filings.enrichment.max_summary_tokens`. This fixes the observed `HTTP 402` where a short filing summary request inherited the global `llm.openrouter.max_tokens` budget and OpenRouter preauthorized it as a 30k-output-token request.

Follow-up on the same day fixed the second `HTTP 402` mode: full 10-Q prompt input could still exceed the current key's prompt budget even after output tokens were capped. SEC enrichment now sends selected filing excerpts, not the entire cleaned filing text.

Another same-day production window showed the key prompt budget had dropped further to 3,256 tokens. The selected excerpts were working directionally, but some TEM filings still landed at 3,956-5,198 prompt tokens, so the extractor now starts more conservatively and retries smaller semantic excerpts on prompt-budget `HTTP 402`.

## What Changed

- Added `EventEngine::with_sec_filings_enrichment_provider(...)`.
- Kept global digest provider fallback for non-web-api embedders that only pass `with_global_digest_provider(...)`.
- Added `build_sec_filings_enrichment_provider(...)` in `hone-web-api`, using `OpenRouterProvider::from_config_with_max_tokens(...)`.
- Added tests for token-cap selection and separate provider wiring.
- Added `extract_filing_llm_context(...)` in `sec_enrichment`, which drops hidden inline XBRL/header noise and selects MD&A, strategic/capital/risk windows, Risk Factors, legal proceedings, or front-loaded 8-K exhibit narratives before the LLM call.
- Updated the SEC enrichment prompt/user message to say the input is selected excerpts rather than a full filing.
- Lowered default selected excerpt size to `10_000` chars and added prompt-budget retries at `7_000`, `4_500`, and `2_800` chars when OpenRouter returns `Prompt tokens limit exceeded`.

## Verification

- `cargo test -p hone-web-api sec_filings_enrichment --lib`
- `cargo test -p hone-event-engine sec_filings_enrichment --lib`
- `cargo check -p hone-web-api`
- `rustfmt --edition 2024 --config skip_children=true --check crates/hone-web-api/src/lib.rs crates/hone-event-engine/src/engine.rs`
- `cargo test -p hone-event-engine sec_enrichment --lib`

`cargo fmt --all -- --check` still fails on unrelated existing formatting drift in `bins/hone-cli/src/*`, `crates/hone-core/src/quiet.rs`, `crates/hone-event-engine/src/global_digest/fetcher.rs`, and `crates/hone-event-engine/src/router/policy.rs`; this handoff does not change those files.

Live OpenRouter smoke before the fix confirmed the boundary: `x-ai/grok-4.1-fast` succeeds with `max_tokens=800` and fails with `max_tokens=30000` under the current key limit.

Follow-up real-data POC used TEM/AMD/COHR 10-Q and TEM 8-K. TEM 10-Q selected excerpts succeeded live on `x-ai/grok-4.1-fast` with 3,170 prompt tokens, 798 completion tokens, and reported cost about `$0.0010`; the earlier full-input failure was `54381 > 6713` prompt tokens.

Later production logs at `2026-05-07 19:59 CST` showed selected excerpts still failing at `5198 > 3256` and `3956 > 3256`, which is why the default budget was tightened and retry budgets were added.

## Risks / Follow-ups

- This fix covers both SEC enrichment output-budget and input-budget failures. Global digest / mainline distill still use the global OpenRouter provider and may need their own output caps or semantic input reducers if they hit the same provider preauthorization boundary.
- S-1 and DEF 14A use the generic front narrative plus keyword-window path; they were not included in the 2026-05-07 real-data POC and should get their own samples if quality issues appear.
- A live SEC filing tick after restart is the best production confirmation, because local tests do not call SEC.gov or OpenRouter.

## Next Entry Point

Start from `crates/hone-event-engine/src/pollers/sec_enrichment.rs` for SEC filing input selection quality. Start from `crates/hone-web-api/src/lib.rs` if another event-engine LLM path needs a dedicated provider cap. Start from `docs/bugs/sec_enrichment_openrouter_max_tokens_402.md` for the observed production failure evidence.

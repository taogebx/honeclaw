  <strong> Hone </strong><br>
  <strong>“Not a chat toy designed to indulge you, but a ruthless defender of your investment discipline.”</strong><br>
  <em>Honeclaw is dedicated to being a professional investment assistant that truly understands you.</em>

Why the name Hone:

"Hone" means to sharpen, to refine an edge. And serious investing is fundamentally just that kind of process: it is not about chasing every piece of news, nor reacting emotionally to every rise and fall, but about continuously honing one’s judgment through research, comparison, review, and long-term discipline.

# 1. 🦅 Honeclaw (Hone Financial)

Honeclaw (or simply Hone) is an open-source personal investment research assistant written in Rust. Unlike the “chatbots” on the market that are accustomed to agreeing with users, Honeclaw is designed as a co-pilot for investment research that is capable of calm thinking, objective judgment, and disciplined restraint.

It integrates into your daily workflow across multiple platforms, helping you track developments at companies you hold, enforce strict investment discipline, run scheduled monitoring tasks, and counter emotional trading impulses with rational data and logic.

The public product website is now live at **[hone-claw.com](https://hone-claw.com)**. It introduces Hone from the user-facing angle: what Hone is, how public chat works, how portfolio monitoring and scheduled tasks fit into daily research, and where to find the roadmap, GitHub repo, Bilibili, and YouTube demos.
